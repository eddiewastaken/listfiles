# listfiles.c

A small programming excercise to familiarise using C in a Unix environment. Uses Unix system calls (mainly file system calls) to perform a recursive traversal of the directory structure, starting with the current working directory, displaying details of each object in the same format as *ls -l* would.

**Note:** This program does not have deal with symbolic links, or device (special) files - just regular files and directories.
